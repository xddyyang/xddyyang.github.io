        <h2>Research Experiences</h2>
        <h3>Revisualization of the architecture-urban history of Jiangnan in its Spatial context: A pilot comparative study in Twin Pagoda and Tongli</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Visualized historical districts of Suzhou within a larger geographical context to understand the impact of geographical features and urbanization on the city's development.</li>
            <li>Employed a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods: Conducted on-site inspections and interviews in Dual Tower District and Tongli Water Town; Documented key historical structures (e.g., ancient towers, bridges) through traditional measurements and hand-drawing; Integrated historical data and hand-drawn content to trace urban evolution; Digitized findings using AutoCAD and ArcGIS, creating a Suzhou historical architecture database.</li>
            <li>Provided insights into Suzhou's urban history and development, highlighting the role of geography and historical structures.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Gentrification in Suzhou: A Tale of Urban Redevelopment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Investigated contemporary urban gentrification trends in second and third-tier Chinese cities, focusing on Suzhou. The aim was to identify potential factors contributing to middle-class growth and assist policymakers and community organizers in more effective urban planning practices.</li>
            <li>Conducted a literature review on middle-class urbanization; Analyzed Suzhou's housing market using ArcGIS and R, visualizing price distribution and changes across the city; Selected key areas (e.g., industrial parks, new districts) based on data analysis; Utilized image recognition from Baidu Street View for further analysis, narrowing down to three specific areas (Shengpu, Yinshan Lake, Taihu New Town); Conducted on-site research in these areas and combined findings with the literature review to assess gentrification.</li>
            <li>Identified gentrification in Shengpu driven by policy and park development, while gentrification in Yinshan Lake did not align with traditional theories; Highlighted the potential benefits of combining GIS with other analytical tools for future urban development forecasting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Migratory Dynamics: The Interplay of Environment and Human Factors on White-fronted Geese</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Studied habitat suitability for migrating Bar-headed Geese in the context of climate change and human impact. Constructed and assessed a Habitat Suitability Model (HSM) to identify critical factors influencing their habitat preferences during migration.</li>
            <li>Utilized Google Earth Engine to download and classify NDVI and NDWI data; Employed Geodetector for non-linear factor analysis, examining interactions between GPS coordinates and environmental variables.</li>
            <li>Developed an HSM providing insights into geese habitat preferences amidst changing conditions; Demonstrated proficiency in advanced remote sensing and data analysis techniques; Discovered non-linear relationships, aiding conservation and management strategies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Quantitative Assessment of Disaster Resilience from Multiple Perspectives and Validation of Key Resilience Indicatorsâ€”A Case Study of Typhoon Disasters in Suzhou (NSFC)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To conduct a quantitative assessment of disaster resilience from multiple perspectives and validate critical resilience indicators, using Suzhou's typhoon disasters as a case study under the NSFC project.</li>
            <li>Assisted in constructing a questionnaire framework based on the Likert scale structure, with a focus on surveying residents' attitudes toward disaster prevention in various communities; Categorized communities according to housing prices and selected specific communities for the study; Carried out extensive community visits, distributed questionnaires, and collected primary data, utilizing Excel for data collection and analysis.</li>
            <li>Contributed to the development of disaster resilience assessment methods, particularly relevant to typhoon disasters, valuable for informed decision-making and disaster management strategies.</li>
        </ul>
